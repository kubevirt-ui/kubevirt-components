## When should I contribute my components to this repository?

When a componenet used by an application is stable it can be published in this components repository so public users could:

- Use the components for exiting new applications
- Study how the component works
- Redistribute the component as they are
- Modified and create better components based on the components in this repository

## How to document my component when contributing to this repository?

Before moving a component to this repo make sure the code is [documented](https://tsdoc.org/) with descriptions and
examples in a [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) doc as needed to help users who are not familiar with the application
and context understand what is the purpose of the component and how to use it.

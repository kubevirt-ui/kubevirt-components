Shims are temporary components to fill a gap between current functionality of the sdk and KubeVirt UI needs.
Use these components carefully as they could be deprecated with future releases of the [Dynamic Plugin SDK](https://github.com/openshift/console/tree/master/frontend/packages/console-dynamic-plugin-sdk).

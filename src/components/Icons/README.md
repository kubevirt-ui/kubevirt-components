They use to give visual clues for KubeVirt UI components based on PatterFly 4.
When needing an icon always look first at [PatternFly 4 guidelines](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/guidelines/icons/#all-icons) and only if the icon you are looking is missing, use KubeVirt UI icons.
Components in this library uses custom icons and a selection from [PatternFly 4](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/guidelines/icons/#all-icons) and [Font Awesome Free](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&m=free).
